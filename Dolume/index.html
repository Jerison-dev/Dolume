I built this slider when I first started to learn JS, you can rebuild it with more readable, simple and less code, I'm too lazy to update it, sorry :)

                            <p>"I started my internship with Dolume this summer, and during my time there, I provided IT support for Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center in Dorchester. Working at Dolume, each day was a new adventure, and I had the opportunity to tackle something new every day, whether it was updating the medical center’s website, helping the doctors and dentists stay up-to-date with their software, or helping analyze where a hack came from. It was super rewarding to be able to have free reign to think creatively about how I approached different problems and I loved being so hands-on with the work. Most of all, I was able to work with an amazing team who was super approachable and would always support me and encourage me to ask any questions I had. I’m so grateful for such an enriching experience at Dolume this summer, and for the opportunity to be a part of such an amazing team. "

                            <p>"My time at Dolume gave me real-life experiences and see what my major is like in the real world. The clients we worked with were awesome; we worked at health centers and schools doing IT and ensuring safety (network security in the buildings). The team that I worked with (Caesar, Janine, and Bo) was excellent and we had a great time. We were very productive together as a team. I would suggest anyone who is looking for an internship to intern at Dolume. They could definitely help you launch your career on the right path."</p>

                                My experience here has been fantastic as I'm able to show my skills since I work independently or as part of a team  (agile methodology). I therefore  highly recommend Dolume because it offers interns and staff  the potential to gain a wealth of knowledge in this varied and supportive environment."</p>

My favorite was when I worked with Janine and James at the HSNHC. I got to learn about the systems they use and operation behind the scenes. I also got to meet many of the staff that work there. They were a delight to work with and a positive experience."</p>
